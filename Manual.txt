*
You can change font and alter other settings through modifying the included 'settings.ini' file. Changing the font may
be desirable if the default font appears too small. Several fonts are included for different screen sizes. It is best to
ensure that the entire player field of view is visible with the chosen font.

--------------------------
ACTION POINTS (AP) & TURNS
--------------------------
*
Action points (AP) represent time, with 100 AP being equivalent to a single turn, and one second. Each action takes a
certain amount of 'time', and therefore AP, to complete. AP is tracked for each squad member individually and is
replenished each turn.
*
If the AP cost for an action exceeds the amount of available AP for the turn available to the squad member, the action
will take multiple turns to complete.
*
While in individual mode, turns will advance automatically until the action is complete. For this reason, be cautious
of performing actions taking several turns such as loading rounds into magazines or healing body parts during combat.
*
While in squad mode, multiple actions can be completed per turn for each squad member as long as enough AP is available
to them. You will have to manually advance turns by pressing the wait keys to complete actions. You can also press shift
+ any of the wait keys to advance turns until each squad member's actions are complete.
*
*
------------------------------
SQUAD MODE - COMBAT & MOVEMENT
------------------------------
*
To enter squad mode, allowing you to attack and move your squad members, press the space key. To exit squad mode, press
escape. You can use the movement keys to change the camera position.
*
- SELECTING SQUAD MEMBERS -
*
Squad members can be selected and un-selected (for movement or attacking enemies) either by pressing [SHIFT] + the
number key corresponding to a squad member, or by left clicking their tile. You can select all squad members by pressing
[A]. The names of selected squad members is displayed on the top left hand corner of the screen, and their tiles are
highlighted.
*
- COMBAT -
*
If enemies are visible, you can switch between which enemy you are targeting by pressing [SPACE] or by left clicking
on their tile. You can change which of the enemy's body parts is being targeted by pressing [ALT].
*
You can see the name of the targeted enemy, which body part is being targeted and its condition, armour, as well as
the distance from the target to the controlled squad member, on the bottom left of the screen. An inverted red triangle
will also be displayed over the selected targeted. You can see more information about the targeted enemy by pressing
[K].
*
While the selected squad member/s are holding weapons, you can press [ENTER] to attack. Once your AP is depleted,
advance to the next turn by pressing any of the wait keys. You can attack a single enemy with multiple player characters
simultaneously by enabling 'selected players attack' by pressing [X]. Only player characters which have been selected
will attack.
*
- SQUAD MOVEMENT -
*
To move squad members while in squad mode, select the squad members you intend to move and right click on the tile you
want the players to move to. You can also set movement commands using the keyboard by pressing [V] to toggle view mode
and pressing [ENTER] to set destination.
*
Their destination is displayed as a green X symbol. Advance turns by pressing any of the wait keys and selected squad
members will automatically navigate to the selected tile. You can remove their destinations by pressing [F].
*
Note: this can be used to navigate different squad members independently to different locations.
*
*
----------------
DAMAGE & HEALING
----------------
*
Attacks damage specific body parts. When body parts have been sufficiently damaged, they will become crippled,
incurring certain debuffs.
*
Bodyparts can be healed by using medkits and bandages and selecting the body part you want to heal. Death occurs when
vital body parts, such as the head, are destroyed.
*
The health of the player's body parts is indicated by the figure at the bottom left of the screen. Green indicates that
the body parts are unharmed, while yellow, orange and red indicate increasing levels of wounding.
*
*
--------------------
EQUIPMENT / LOAD OUT
--------------------
*
Items including weapons and armour can be equipped from the inventory [I]. Equipped items can be inspected and
un-equipped with through the equipment menu [E].
*
You can interact with your held weapon by pressing [Q]. Through this menu, you can perform actions such as loading and
unloading your firearm and change its current fire mode (i.e. switch semi-automatic and fully automatic fire).
*
The loadout menu, which allows the player to interact with equipped magazines as well as primary and secondary weapons,
can be accessed by pressing [R]. Equipping weapons to the primary or secondary slot allows the player to quickly
switch between weapons during combat. To reload magazine fed guns, magazines must first be assigned to the loadout by
interacting with them in the inventory menu.
*
Each squad member has a limited amount of small, medium and large magazine loadout slots. The amount of available
magazine slots can be seen from the loadout menu. Magazines can be loaded with rounds by interacting with them from
either the inventory or load out menus.
*
*
-------------
ATTACK STYLES
-------------
*
You can change your attack style by pressing [S]. The players attack style alters the AP cost of ranged attacks,
accuracy with firearms and the duration of fully automatic weapons fire.
*
In the 'Precise' attack style, attacks cost additional AP but are more accurate, best suited for longer range
engagements. In this mode, bursts of fully automatic gun fire will also be short and controlled. In the 'Close Quarters'
attack style, attacks cost less AP but are less accurate. In this mode, many rounds will be fired when a fully automatic
firearm is shot. 'Measured' serves as a compromise between the two.
*
*
----
GUNS
----
*
Guns are made up of weapon parts. Each weapon part has unique properties which influence how the gun behaves. A guns
component parts can be viewed from the inspect menu. Weapons can be disassembled into their component parts through the
interaction menu.
*
Weapons and their parts can be found in different conditions, which can be viewed from the inspect menu. Accuracy
condition indicates the condition of the parts as it pertains to accuracy of the weapon, for example condition of the
bore. Guns with a worse accuracy condition will be less accurate in combat.
*
Function condition indicates the condition of the parts as it pertains to the cycling of the action and jamming. Guns
with a worse functional condition will be more prone to jamming. Gun parts can be repaired through the use of weapon
part repair kits.
*
To create a gun from parts, enter the crafting menu by pressing [C].
*
Skills govern performance when using certain weapon types, including accuracy, recoil control, reloading speed, and
equip speed. Skills can be trained by using the associated weapon type.
*
The weapons type is influenced by its parts, and can be viewed by inspecting it. You can see your proficiency with
different weapon types by using the skill menu, which is accessed by pressing [Z].
*
*
---------------
ITEM PROPERTIES
---------------
*
Item properties can be viewed by selecting the 'inspect' option on an item. The following is a non-exhaustive list of
item properties for reference.
*
- BULLETS -
*
Bullet Mass: Mass of projectile. The higher the bullets mass, the more it will penetrate armour and soft tissue at a
given velocity
*
Charge Mass: Mass of propellant i.e. powder in the round. Higher charge mass corresponds with greater velocity, but
causes greater recoil.
*
Bullet Diameter: The greater the diameter of the bullet, the more tissue is destroyed at the cost of less penetration
in tissue.
*
Bullet Velocity: A projectile with greater velocity will penetrate through more armour and soft tissue.
*
Shot Sound: How far away (in metres) the round can be heard from, alerting certain enemies.
*
Bullet Spread Modifier: Alters how accurate shot placement is.
*
Ballistic Coefficient: Projectiles with a greater ballistic coefficient experience less bullet drop due to air
resistance. May be important for very long range shots.
*
- MAGAZINES -
*
AP to Load: AP cost to reload magazine per round
*
Failure Chance: Chance for your gun to jam during firing as a result of the magazine
*
- GUNS -
*
Zero Range: The distance at which the axis of the weapons sights intercepts the bullets flight path. The weapon will
be most accurate at this range.
*
Sight Height Over Mount / Sight Mount Height Over Bore: Height of the weapons sights above the axis of the barrel.
Changes trajectory of the bullet relative to the axis of the sight.
*
AP Cost Distance Modifier: Changes AP cost of attacks per metre, i.e. greater values cause longer distance shots to
cost more AP.
*
AP Cost Target Acquisition: Changes AP cost of switching between targets.
*
Muzzle Brake Efficiency: Amount of recoil resulting from the jet effect from bullets exiting the muzzle that is
eliminated.
*
Part Condition (Accuracy): Physical condition of weapon parts affecting accuracy of the firearm. Weapons with lower
accuracy condition, for example as a result of a barrel in poor condition, the gun will suffer an accuracy penalty when
fired.
*
Part Condition (Function): Physical condition of weapon parts affecting reliable cycling and function of the firearms.
Weapons with lower functional condition, for example as a result of a receiver in poor condition will be more likely to
jam when fired.
*
Action Cycling AP Cost: AP cost to cycle the action after each shot, i.e. work the bolt of a bolt action rifle
*
- ARMOUR -
*
Ballistic Protection: Protection from projectile-based attacks. Equivalent to inches of mild steel.
*
Physical Protection: Protection from melee based attacks.
*
Armour Coverage: Chance that when attacked, an attack on the equipped body part will hit the armour.
*
- GUN PARTS -
*
Compatible Parts: Which parts of a given type are compatible with this part in crafting.
*
Has Attachment Points: Which attachment points for additional parts, e.g. muzzle devices, are featured on the part.
*
Additional Parts Required: Additional parts or parts of a certain part types required for successful crafting of an
item.
*
Compatible Attachment Points: Attachment points to which a given part can be attached to.
