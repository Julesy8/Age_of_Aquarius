 - ATTACK MODE -

On the bottom left of the screen, you can see how much AP (action points) the player has. Action points represent the
remaining amount of time the player has to complete actions within that turn. Since one turn equates to one second,
1 AP = 1/100th of a second. Different actions take different amounts of time, and therefore AP, to complete. If an
action costs more AP than is available, player turns will be skipped until the action can be completed.
