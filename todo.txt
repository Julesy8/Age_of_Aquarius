Ideal item action handling:

Event handler --> consumable.get_action -> Action -> consumable.activate
      ^        |             |
      |        V             V
      ------------------------

New Model With Queue

-> = calls

Event handler --> consumable.get_action -> action.consume_ap / queue action -> Action.perform -> consumable.activate
      ^        |             |                      |
      |        V             V                      V
      ------------------------            consumable.get_ap_cost

SQUAD MODE

event_handler.handle_events -> event_handler.handle_action -> action.handle_action -> engine.handle_queued_actions
                                                                                          (player end turn)
                                                                                                  |
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     |
     V
for action.handle_action for actions in action.queue -> perform / tick down


input handler: reload (consumables class) -> calls action -> reloads

After that trading and other party options - reloading, ammo priority etc. Ammo priority should be a property of the
magazine class itself.

Extended Goals
-borderlands style weapon naming
-new weapon property - needs_mag_to_fire
-ability to single load rounds into guns for emergencies
-grenades
-dialogue
-doors
-Better level progression - alternative levels
-Trigger mods
-unique enemies which spawn once per game
-in the dungeon you find enemies using your looted equipment from previous runs
-more room shapes on level generation
-weapon graphics
-try reducing exe size - use UPX
-grave yard (call it cemetary)

dialogue
- reloading
- out of ammo
- death rattle
- pain

- squad member dies
- sees abomination
- enemies dead (room clear)
