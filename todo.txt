-more room shapes on level generation
-weapon graphics

- instead of using randint, use int(128 * random.random()) - https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/slow-and-fast-methods-for-generating-random-integers-in-python/

# this equation is not even slightly realistic, but it works as a gamified stat since actually
# calculating stability would require lots of data I don't have
yaw_depth = max(0, (0.28/projectile config) * (velocity (fps) /2600) * (bullet length (inches) / 2.26) * 12 * randrange(0.3))
