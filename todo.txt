TO DO
-----

-multple sizes of icon, can add new sizes in main.spec

Ideal item action handling:

Event handler --> consumable.get_action -> Action -> consumable.activate
      ^        |             |
      |        V             V
      ------------------------

input handler: reload (consumables class) -> calls action -> reloads

next up - queueing player actions

new weapon property - needs_mag_to_fire
ability to single load rounds into guns for emergencies
add armour
armour weight changes dexterity and walk speed

Extended Goals
-calling input handlers from consumable and more generally actually using the consumable class properly
-Blood loss
-Less confusing control scheme
-Name and class select on menu screen
-Better level progression - alternative levels
-Trigger mods
-Attack queue for player in attack mode, VATS style
-Full mouse controls
-Squad members
-unique enemies which spawn once per game
-in the dungeon you find enemies using your looted equipment from previous runs
-more room shapes on level generation
-weapon graphics
-try reducing exe size - use UPX

- instead of using randint, use int(128 * random.random()) - https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/slow-and-fast-methods-for-generating-random-integers-in-python/

# this equation is not even slightly realistic, but it works as a gamified stat since actually
# calculating stability would require lots of data I don't have
yaw_depth = max(0, (0.28/projectile config) * (velocity (fps) /2600) * (bullet length (inches) / 2.26) * 12 * randrange(0.3))



-save guns to look at in main menu
-grave yard

1.5 seconds average to draw, aim, shoot - pistol
can pull trigger 4 times per second

pistol base line - Glock 17
rifle base line - M4

equip (pistol - from holster) - 75
equip (rifle - from sling) - 100
acquire target (pistol) - 50
acquire target (rifle) - 30
shoot (pistol and rifle) -

How squad mechanics should work
- new player characters are found at random between stages
- use mouse drag/click to select units
- can also use number keys to select inividual units
- must select units individually to attack
- upon entering combat, a new mode is activated where actions are queued, press another key to confirm all actions at
once and advance one enemy turn. If character turn still in progress (no ap), can't do any moves
- shows current character name and zooms in on them when selected
- select characters, click where to move them to and then hit a button to confirm, move incrementally towards position.
Movement is interupted when they enter combat
- should be a menu from which you can access various squad options including having all player characters reload,
reload magazines and weapons in loadout, heal and trade items between player characters when not in combat
- way to preference ammo type for automatic reloading
