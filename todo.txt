TO DO
-----
-iron out max overlapping rooms, make ai which has its own fov for looking and hearing
-adjust entity spawn rate
-make room player spawns in enclosed rather than open so the player can't see any enemies on spawn
-change rendering options to make window non-resizable
-random wall obstacles generated within rooms
-player variable walk speed
-check to see if new ai works
